# Weather App

This is a simple weather application built with Node.js, Express, and Handlebars. The application serves a weather forecast based on user input, allowing both `GET` and `POST` requests to fetch weather data for a specified location.

## Features

- Retrieve weather information based on an address input.
- Supports both `GET` and `POST` requests for fetching weather data.
- Renders views using Handlebars templates.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher recommended)
- **NPM** (comes with Node.js)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**:

   - Create a `.env` file in the project root (if not already present).
   - Define `PORT` if you want to specify a custom port (optional, defaults to 3000).

## Project Structure

├── templates/
│   ├── views/              # Handlebars views (e.g., index.hbs)
│   └── partials/           # Handlebars partial templates (e.g., header.hbs)

├── app.js                  # Main application file
└── package.json            # NPM metadata and dependencies
```

## Scripts

- **Start the server**:

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

- **Run in development mode** (if using nodemon):

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

## Usage

1. **Starting the App**:

   Run `npm start` to launch the server on the specified port (defaults to `3000` if not defined in `.env`).

2. **Endpoints**:

   - **GET /** - Renders the homepage (`index.hbs`) with a title.
   - **GET /weather** - Requires an `address` query parameter. Returns weather data for the specified address.
   - **POST /weather** - Accepts JSON data in the request body with an `address` field. Returns weather data for the specified address.
   - **GET /** (404 Page) - Renders a 404 page if the requested route is not found.

3. **Example POST Request**:

   Use a tool like **Postman** or **curl** to send a POST request:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/weather -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"address": "New York"}'
   ```

## Technologies Used

- **Express**: Fast, unopinionated web framework for Node.js.
- **Handlebars**: Template engine for rendering HTML views.
- **path**: Core Node.js module for handling file paths.
- **dotenv** (optional): For loading environment variables if needed.
